# Soartex-Ores

This repository is for holding all the master files for ingots, dusts, ores etc... to be used with mods for our modded support. With the new model system in vanilla we can map textures from the mods to this pack. Thus, cutting down on the download size of modpack support, along making Fanver modded now consistent across mods. Meaning no more guessing or getting confused with textures!

All changes here are automatically packaged with scripts and made available in the patcher and on the downloads page!
